This is a simple piece of malware that is configured to call back to an ip address to check for a task.
Its primary task is to upload a dll, write it to the hdd, and execute it.

Never got around to iplementing additional functionailty.
It also has a lot of spaghetti code!! :-P

It connects back to the "hampost" which is a different project... also spaghetti :-P
